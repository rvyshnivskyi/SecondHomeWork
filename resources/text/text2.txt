President Trump’s day trip Tuesday to storm-ravaged Texas, which saw him visit areas largely spared by Hurricane Harvey, wasn’t even over before the criticism started. Despite the loss of life and utter devastation around the state, Trump “managed to turn attention on himself,” a Washington Post reporter wrote. Trump didn’t “see an inch of rain or get near a flooded street,” Politico noted. Even former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, typically an ally, called out Trump’s lack of “empathy for the people who suffer.”

But none of those perceived missteps bothered the ethics hawks at Citizens for Ethics, who are suggesting that Trump got just what he wanted out of his trip to Texas: Tons of free publicity for his “USA” hats.

The first photos of Trump wearing the all-caps white and red hats came from the White House, which distributed shots of Trump wearing both colors on back-to-back days.

On Tuesday morning, as he left the White House, Trump carried a white one in his hand and then he wore one during most of the Texas trip. Meanwhile, Trump’s campaign website was selling them for $40 a pop.

“Even removed from the hurricane, it’s pretty inappropriate,” CREW spokesman Jordan Libowitz told CNN. He added that while Trump does not appear to be breaking any laws, he’s not doing “what is ethically right.”

Walter Schaub, the former head of the Office of Government Ethics who resigned because of Trump’s allergy to ethical behavior, weighed in too.
